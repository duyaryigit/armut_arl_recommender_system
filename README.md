### Business Problem

Armut, which is Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services. It enables easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation, and transportation with just a few touches on a computer or smartphone. An association rule learning-based product recommendation system is desired to be created using the dataset containing users who received services and the categories of services they received.
